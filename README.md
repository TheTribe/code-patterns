Welcome to code-patterns
=============

## A general-purpose set of libraries designed to make life easier for .NET developers ##

Here are the highlights:

* This is the official codebase used for [NuGet distributions of Patterns](https://nuget.org/packages?q=id%3A+Patterns%3B+author%3A+%22John+Batte%22 "'Patterns' packages with 'John Batte' listed as the author").
* Check the [official code patterns site](http://TheTribe.github.io/code-patterns/ "featuring code samples and Doxygen-generated html") for API documentation and additional information.
* Head over to [the wiki](https://github.com/TheTribe/code-patterns/wiki) for user-contributed content.
* You can also check out [the license file](https://github.com/TheTribe/code-patterns/blob/master/license.txt "FreeBSD (2-Clause)") if you're wondering about that.

Hopefully you'll find these libraries as useful as I do. Cheers!
