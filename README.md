=============

#### Libraries that make life easier for developers

Here are the highlights:

* This is the official codebase used for [NuGet distributions of Patterns][nuget]. Releases to NuGet are considered **stable**.
* Waiting for a bugfix that hasn't made it all the way upstream yet? Those of you that don't mind having a **pre-release** dependency can pick up [CI builds at MyGet][myget].
* Check the [official code-patterns site][site] for API documentation, unit test reports, the developers' blog, and more.
* Head over to [the wiki][wiki] for code samples and other content.
* You can also check out [the license file][license] if you're wondering about that.

Hopefully you'll find these libraries as useful as I do. Cheers!
