Code Patterns for .NET
=============

# Welcome! #
## You've found my .NET utility belt. ##
## It's constantly growing. ##
## Its entire goal is to make life easier. ##

Here are the highlights:

* This is the official codebase used for [NuGet distributions of Patterns](https://nuget.org/packages?q=id%3A+Patterns%3B+author%3A+%22John+Batte%22).
* Check the [official code patterns site](http://jbatte47.github.io/code-patterns/) for API documenation and additional information.
* Head over to [the wiki](https://github.com/jbatte47/code-patterns/wiki) for user-contributed content.
* You can also check out [the license file](https://github.com/jbatte47/code-patterns/blob/master/license.txt "FreeBSD (2-Clause)") if you're wondering about that.

Hopefully you'll find these libraries as useful as I do. Cheers!
