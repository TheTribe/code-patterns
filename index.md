# Code Patterns - Home #

*Code Patterns* project provides assistance with tasks such as handling errors, managing collections, matching text with patterns we expect to see, or configuring our apps at runtime. These are just a few examples of the sort of thing the *Code Patterns* project is built to help out with. This wiki will attempt to guide you through the entire *Code Patterns* collection of libraries. Below you will find links to documentation for specific types and members, as well as code examples that demonstrate the value of those components.

Of course, any contributions are welcome. If you have a Pattern you feel is common enough to be included but is missing, please add it and send your merge request in. This project is already a melting pot, so the more the merrier -- provided your addition makes sense that is!

## Getting Started ##

The easiest way to integrate *Code Patterns* into your solution is to use [NuGet](http://nuget.org/). The current codebase is reflected in the "beta" releases. [See NuGet.org for details](http://nuget.org/packages/Patterns/ "Code Patterns on NuGet.org").

## Assemblies ##

- [Patterns](./assembly)
- Patterns.Autofac
- Patterns.Testing
- Patterns.Framework (various mixins for common CLR types to ease integration with Patterns; coming soon)
